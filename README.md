- **Shear Force Diagrams** - Display shear force distribution

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- Canvas API
- Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **Online Demo**: Visit [BeamFEA Live](https://arnoutzw.github.io/mech-fea-app/)
2. **Local Setup**: Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arnoutzw/mech-fea-app.git
cd mech-fea-app
# Open index.html in your browser
```

### Installation

This is a PWA that works entirely in your browser with no server or dependencies required. For best experience:
- Install as a PWA on your device for offline use
- Use a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Usage

1. **Define Beam**: Set beam length and select cross-section type
2. **Select Material**: Choose from built-in materials or create custom ones
3. **Add Supports**: Place pin, roller, or fixed supports
4. **Apply Loads**: Add point loads, distributed loads, and moments
5. **Analyze**: View deflection, bending moment, and shear force diagrams
6. **Iterate**: Modify parameters and instantly see updated analysis results
